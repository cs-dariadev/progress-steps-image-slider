# Progress Steps Image Slider

Project 2 of the 50 Projects 50 Days course by @bradtraversy.

This is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript code for a progress steps and image slider component. 
The code provides a visual representation of progress steps with circles and a progress bar, 
allowing the user to navigate through the steps using the "Prev" and "Next" buttons. 
Additionally, it includes an image slider functionality where images can be displayed one at a time.
